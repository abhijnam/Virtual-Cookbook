# Virtual-Cookbook
A simple program to give quick and easy access to recipes for students or working professionals who donâ€™t have time to search the internet for meals.
To use this program you would need a Python IDE such as Pycharm, IDLE or Spyder. Personally I would recommend VS-code.
This program is decision oriented where the user selects between 3 options of vegan, vegetarian, and classic meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.This allows them to choose what meal recipes they would like to see from which they could exit at any time.
Copy and Paste the code into the IDE and run the code to see how it works.
