# Most people have a hard time deciding what to eat for breakfast and Lunch , especially sleep deprived university students, so this program gives them the option to pick out different reciepes to make one by one. This is better than a website since they won't be overwhelmed by choice and gives a choice to everyon's eating choices(ex: if someone is vegan or if someone is vegetarian)
